</1></b></font><br>
<br>Joy to the world! The Lord is come
<br>Let earth receive her King
<br>Let every heart prepare Him room
<br>And heaven and nature sing
<br>And heaven and nature sing
<br>And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing
<br>
<br>Joy to the Earth! The Saviour reigns
<br>Let men their songs employ
<br>While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
<br>Repeat the sounding joy
<br>Repeat the sounding joy
<br>Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
<br>
<br>No more let sins and sorrow grow
<br>Nor thorns infest the ground
<br>He comes to make His blessings flow
<br>Far as the curse is found
<br>Far as the curse is found
<br>Far as, far as, the curse is found
<br>
<br>He rules the world with truth and grace
<br>And makes the nations prove
<br>The glories of His righteousness
<br>And wonders of His love
<br>And wonders of His love
<br>And wonders, wonders, of His love!
