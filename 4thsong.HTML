<br>You know Dasher and Dancer
<br>And Prancer and Vixen
<br>Comet and Cupid 
<br>And Donner and Blitzen
<br>But do you recall
<br>The most famous reindeer of all?
<br>
<br>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
<br>Had a very shiny nose
<br>And if you ever saw it
<br>You would even say it glows
<br>
<br>All of the other reindeer
<br>Used to laugh and call him names
<br>They never let poor Rudolph
<br>Join in any reindeer games
<br>
<br>Then one foggy Christmas Eve
<br>Santa came to say
<br>“Rudolph with your nose so bright
<br>Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?”
<br>
<br>Then how the reindeer loved him
<br>As they shouted out with glee (yipee)
<br>“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
<br>You’ll go down in history”
