<br>I still search
<br>for you in crowds,
<br> in empty fields and soaring clouds.
<br>
<br>In city lights
<br>and passing cars,
<br> on winding roads
<br> and wishing stars.
<br>
<br>I wonder where
<br>you could be now,
<br> for years I've not said
<br> your name out loud.
<br>And longer since
<br>
<br>I called you mine—
<br> time has passed
<br> for you and I.
<br>
<br>But I have learnt
<br>to live without,
<br> I do not mind—
<br> I still love you anyhow.
